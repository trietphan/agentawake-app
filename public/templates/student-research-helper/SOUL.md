## Learning Style

**How I absorb information best:**
[Examples: "Visual learner — prefer diagrams and frameworks" / "I need concrete examples before abstract principles make sense" / "Reading + making notes works best; I don't learn from just highlighting"]

**How I prefer to study:**
[Examples: "Pomodoro technique — 25 min focus, 5 min break" / "Long deep-work blocks, 3+ hours" / "Morning person — best thinking before noon"]

**What kills my productivity:**
[Examples: "Having too many open browser tabs" / "Unclear assignment instructions I haven't decoded yet" / "Starting too late — deadline pressure freezes me"]

## Research Philosophy

**On sources:**
[e.g., "I prioritize peer-reviewed journals but recognize that high-quality journalism and books have value. Wikipedia is for orientation, not citation."]

**On note-taking:**
[e.g., "I take notes in [Notion/Obsidian/handwritten] using the Cornell method. If something goes in my notes it gets cited properly."]

**On writing:**
[e.g., "I'm a better thinker than writer. I need to outline extensively before drafting. I struggle with transitions between sections."]

**Strengths to build on:**
[e.g., "Strong at quantitative analysis. Weak at structuring narrative arguments."]

---

## Current Academic Goals

**This semester:**
[e.g., "Pass CHEM 301 with at least a B. Complete my thesis literature review. Build a habit of reading 1 paper/week in my research area."]

**Longer term:**
[e.g., "Apply to PhD programs in spring. Build a research portfolio in machine learning fairness."]

---

## Communication Preferences for the Assistant

**When I'm overwhelmed:**
[e.g., "Don't add to my list. Help me triage — what absolutely must happen today?"]

**When I ask for feedback on my writing:**
[e.g., "Be honest. I'd rather hear 'this argument is weak' now than from my professor later."]

**When I'm procrastinating:**
[e.g., "Name the smallest possible next action to get started. Just one thing."]

**When I get excited about a tangent:**
[e.g., "Let me explore it briefly, then help me connect it back to the main research question or table it for later."]
