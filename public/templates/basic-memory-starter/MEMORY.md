# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

*This is your agent's persistent memory. Unlike a conversation, this file survives session restarts. Your agent reads this every session to understand your context, preferences, and history.*

*Update freely. Delete outdated entries. Think of this like a living document, not a transcript.*

## Preferences

*Things your agent should always know about how you like to work.*

### Communication
- [e.g., "I prefer bullet lists over paragraphs for summaries"]
- [e.g., "Don't add pleasantries before delivering information"]
- [e.g., "When I ask for a draft, give me the full thing — not a partial with 'and so on'"]

### Work Style
- [e.g., "I work in focused 90-minute blocks. Don't suggest multi-hour marathons."]
- [e.g., "I'm a morning person. Schedule anything time-sensitive for AM."]
- [e.g., "I like to see options, not just one recommendation"]

### Technical
- [e.g., "Always use TypeScript, not JavaScript"]
- [e.g., "I prefer functional components in React"]
- [e.g., "Use 2-space indentation, single quotes in JS/TS"]

## Tools & Stack

*What you use regularly — so your agent doesn't suggest alternatives you don't use.*

| Category | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Writing | [e.g., Notion / Obsidian / Google Docs] |
| Code editor | [e.g., Cursor / VS Code] |
| AI platforms | [e.g., Claude, ChatGPT] |
| Communication | [e.g., Slack, Discord, email] |
| Project management | [e.g., Linear, Notion, Trello] |
| [Add more rows as needed] | |

---

## Key Decisions

*Log important decisions here so your agent (and you) can reference them later.*

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| [YYYY-MM-DD] | [What was decided] | [Why] |
| | | |

---

## Lessons Learned

*Capture hard-won insights here. Your agent learns from these.*

- [e.g., "When I ask for 'quick' help, I mean <5 minutes of reading, not 5 bullet points that require follow-up"]
- [e.g., "I get overwhelmed by too many options. 2-3 max, with a recommendation."]
- [e.g., "The first draft matters less than I think. Ship and iterate."]

---

## Ongoing Context

*Stuff that doesn't fit elsewhere but matters for continuity.*

[Free-form notes. Examples:]
- "Currently reading: [BOOK] — relevant to [PROJECT]"
- "Had a frustrating week with [SITUATION] — context if I seem stressed"
- "Planning to [BIG CHANGE] around [DATE]"

---

## How to Update This File

Your agent should proactively suggest updates when:
- A project status changes
- A new preference becomes clear from your requests
- An important decision is made
- A lesson is learned the hard way

You can also just tell it: "Add this to my memory: [fact]"

**Golden rule:** If it would take more than 30 seconds to re-explain next session, write it here.
