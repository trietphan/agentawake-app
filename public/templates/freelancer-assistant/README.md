# Freelancer Assistant — Setup Guide

**Time to set up: ~15 minutes**
**Works with:** Claude, ChatGPT, OpenClaw, Cursor

## What You're Getting

Four files that turn your AI assistant into a business partner who:

- Remembers all your clients without being re-briefed
- Tracks every project's status automatically
- Drafts emails in your professional voice
- Flags overdue invoices before they become awkward conversations
- Defends your scope when clients start adding "quick" requests

---

## Quick Start (15 minutes)

### 1. Fill in SOUL.md first (5 min)
Your professional identity, values, and communication style. This is what makes the assistant sound like YOU, not a generic business bot.

Key things to fill in:
- Business name and services
- Your professional positioning
- How you communicate with clients (formal? warm? direct?)
- Your red flags (clients you've learned to avoid)

### 2. Load your clients into MEMORY.md (5 min)
For each active client, fill in one block:
- Name, company, contact details
- Current project and status
- Rate and billing terms
- Communication style notes

Don't worry about being comprehensive. Add 2-3 clients now, add more over time.

### 3. Set up AGENTS.md (2 min)
Replace `[FREELANCER NAME]` with your name. Update the rate card policy to match your actual rates in MEMORY.md.

### 4. Load into your platform (3 min)
*(Same as any AgentAwake template — see below)*

## Daily Usage Patterns

**Morning check-in:**
> "Quick morning briefing — any overdue invoices, upcoming deadlines, or follow-ups I should handle today?"

**Before a client call:**
> "Brief me on [CLIENT NAME] — where are we on their project and what do I need to know?"

**After a client call:**
> "Update [CLIENT NAME]'s project: we agreed to add X. Update the status to Y. Note that they mentioned Z."

**Drafting an email:**
> "Draft a check-in email to [CLIENT] about the [PROJECT] project. We're waiting on their feedback on the first draft, sent last Tuesday."

**Handling scope creep:**
> "[CLIENT] just asked if we could also do [NEW THING]. Is this in scope? Help me respond professionally."

**Chasing an invoice:**
> "Invoice #INV-003 for [CLIENT] is 12 days overdue. Draft a polite follow-up."

## Memory Maintenance

After significant interactions, tell your assistant:
- "Mark [CLIENT]'s invoice #INV-X as paid."
- "Update [PROJECT] status to 'In review' — sent the first draft today."
- "Add [NEW CLIENT] to my clients list." (then fill in the template together)
- "Add a lesson: [what you learned]"

Once a week, review the Invoices section to stay on top of cash flow.

## The Scope Creep Email Templates

These are worth building once and referencing forever.

**Level 1 — Gentle flag (when the client may not realize):**
> "Just a quick note — [NEW REQUEST] falls outside the original scope of our [PROJECT] engagement. Happy to include it as part of a separate work order. Want me to put together a quick estimate?"

**Level 2 — Firmer (when it's clearly extra work):**
> "I want to be transparent about scope on this one. The original project covered [ORIGINAL SCOPE]. What you're describing is [NEW REQUEST], which is additional work. I'd need to put together a change order before we proceed. Shall I do that?"

**Level 3 — Non-negotiable (when it's gotten out of hand):**
> "I've noticed our project has expanded significantly from the original agreement. To make sure we're set up for a successful outcome (and to protect both our time), I'd like to revisit the scope and pricing before continuing. Can we schedule 15 minutes to realign?"

## Pro Tips

**Charge what you're worth.** Set real rates in MEMORY.md and don't undercut them. Your assistant will reference these every time and stop you from discounting out of habit.

**Document everything.** After every important client conversation, update the relevant project entry. Your assistant is only as good as the context you give it.

**Use it for the uncomfortable emails.** Scope creep, overdue invoices, rate increases — these are the conversations freelancers avoid. Your assistant drafts them neutrally and professionally.
