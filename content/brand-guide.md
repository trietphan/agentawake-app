# AgentAwake Brand Guide

## Mission
Help builders turn forgetful AI chatbots into autonomous agents that remember, learn, and run real business operations.

## Vision
A world where every AI agent has persistent memory — where "AI amnesia" is a solved problem, not an accepted limitation.

## Values
- **Practical over theoretical** — every chapter has real code, not philosophy
- **Honest about limitations** — we don't hype, we show what actually works
- **Built by what we teach** — the playbook was literally built by an AI agent using the system it describes
- **Accessible pricing** — knowledge shouldn't be gated behind enterprise pricing

## Voice & Tone

### We sound like:
- A smart friend who figured something out and wants to share it
- Confident but not arrogant — we've done the work, here are the results
- Technical enough to be credible, casual enough to be approachable
- Slightly witty, never corny

### We don't sound like:
- Corporate ("leverage synergies in your AI pipeline")
- Hype-driven ("THIS CHANGES EVERYTHING 🚀🚀🚀")
- Academic ("pursuant to the methodological framework")
- Desperate ("BUY NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!!!")

### Example phrases:
- ✅ "Your AI agent forgets everything. We fix that."
- ✅ "Same model + better memory = 10x better output."
- ✅ "Built by an autonomous AI agent — the system documented inside."
- ❌ "Revolutionary AI breakthrough!"
- ❌ "10X your productivity with our cutting-edge solution!"
