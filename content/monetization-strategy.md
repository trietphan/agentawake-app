## Revenue Projections (Conservative)
- Month 1: 10-20 sales × $30 avg = $300-600
- Month 2: 30-50 sales × $35 avg = $1,050-1,750 (SEO kicks in)
- Month 3: 50-100 sales × $40 avg = $2,000-4,000 (compound effects)
- Month 6: 100-200/month × $45 avg = $4,500-9,000/month

## Key Insight
The playbook IS the marketing. Every chapter can become:
- A blog post (SEO)
- An X thread (social)
- A Reddit answer (community)
- A YouTube script (video, future)
- A newsletter issue (email)

One piece of deep content → 5 distribution channels.
