# AgentAwake Newsletter Welcome Drip (5 Emails)

## Email 1 — Immediate
**Subject:** Welcome + Your Free Templates (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, MEMORY.md)

**Preview text:** Start here: copy-paste the 3 files that stop AI agent amnesia in one afternoon.

**Body:**
Hey — welcome in 👋

You’re now inside AgentAwake.

Most people try to “prompt” their way into agent reliability.
That usually lasts 1 day.

The real unlock is memory architecture.

So here are your free starter templates (copy-paste ready):

---

### 1) `AGENTS.md` (operating manual)
```md
# AGENTS.md

## Every Session
1. Read SOUL.md
2. Read USER.md
3. Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (today + yesterday)
4. If main/private session: read MEMORY.md

## Safety
- Ask before external actions
- Never leak private info
- Prefer reversible changes
```

### 2) `SOUL.md` (behavior + communication defaults)
```md
# SOUL.md

- Be direct and useful
- Skip fluff and performative politeness
- Prefer concrete outputs over vague advice
- Protect privacy by default
```

### 3) `MEMORY.md` (long-term curated memory)
```md
# MEMORY.md

## Durable Preferences
- Preferred communication style:
- Risk tolerance:
- Default output format:

## Recurring Projects
- 

## Lessons Learned
- 
```

If you do only one thing today: create these 3 files in your workspace.

## Email 2 — Day 2
**Subject:** The #1 Mistake Everyone Makes With AI Agents

**Preview text:** They store “everything” and call it memory. That’s exactly why their agent gets worse over time.

**Body:**
Quick truth:

The biggest AI-agent mistake isn’t bad prompting.
It’s bad memory architecture.

Most people dump everything into one giant file/folder/thread.
Result:
- Retrieval quality drops
- Contradictions pile up
- Cost climbs
- Agent confidence stays high while accuracy drops

That’s memory rot.

## The fix: 3 memory lanes

1. **Knowledge Base (durable)**
   - Project docs, SOPs, architecture, recurring facts

2. **Daily Notes (volatile)**
   - What changed today, blockers, decisions, open loops

3. **Tacit Knowledge (behavioral)**
   - Style, preferences, communication rules, risk posture

Different lane = different retention policy.

If something is true only this week, it should never live in long-term memory.

If it changes your behavior every day, it belongs in tacit knowledge.

If it’s a repeatable decision, promote it from daily notes to knowledge base.

That’s how your agent compounds instead of decays.

## Email 3 — Day 5
**Subject:** How Our Agent Makes $6K/month

**Preview text:** Not a hype thread — real stack, real numbers, and where the margin actually comes from.

**Body:**
Let’s talk real numbers.

One of our favorite operating stacks combines:
- Daily analysis newsletter
- Paid community updates
- Productized playbook sales

### Example monthly math
- Newsletter: 100 subscribers × $19 = **$1,900**
- Community: 200 members × $15 = **$3,000**
- Product sales + affiliate tail = **~$1,200**

**Total: ~$6,100/month**

Typical monthly infra cost:
- Model/API + tooling + hosting: **~$25–$120**

The margin is high because the agent handles repeatable operations:
- Research prep
- Draft generation
- Scheduled publishing
- Follow-up workflows

Human role stays high-leverage:
- Final judgment
- Positioning
- Offer design

## Email 5 — Day 14
**Subject:** Last Chance: The System That Built Itself

**Preview text:** Final reminder before this welcome offer closes.

**Body:**
Last welcome note from me.

If you’ve been “meaning to set this up,” this is your nudge.

AgentAwake exists because the system worked on itself:
- It documented its own memory protocol
- It shipped chapters while running
- It turned repeat tasks into reusable workflows

That’s the core promise:
Build once, then compound.

### What readers report most often
- “My agent finally remembers context across days.”
- “I stopped restarting from scratch every morning.”
- “The templates saved me weeks of trial-and-error.”

If you want in, now’s the best time.

Use code **WELCOME15** for 15% off (optional):

After this email, the welcome sequence ends.

If you join later, awesome.
If you join now, you’ll move faster.

Either way: keep building.
