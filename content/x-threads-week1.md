# AgentAwake — X Threads (Week 1)

## Thread 1 — AI Agent Amnesia (Pinned Candidate)

1/ Most AI agents fail for one reason:
not bad prompts, not bad models — **amnesia**.

2/ If your agent asks for the same context every day, it has no memory architecture.
It’s basically day-one intern mode forever.

3/ We fixed this with a stupidly simple stack:
- long-term knowledge files
- daily execution log
- tacit preferences file

4/ Same model.
Way better output.
Less re-explaining.
Lower token waste.

5/ The compounding effect is real:
Day 1 = reactive assistant
Day 30 = proactive operator
Day 90 = domain-aware teammate

6/ Hot take:
A bigger context window is not a memory strategy.
It’s just a bigger backpack.

7/ If your agent keeps forgetting everything,
start with memory architecture before changing models.

8/ We’re building this in public at @AwakeAgent.

## Thread 2 — Build in Public Weekly Recap

5/ Design updates:
we moved from “one-color SaaS page” to a livelier modern look:
subtle motion + richer palette + cleaner mobile flow.

6/ Next sprint:
- pinned thread + daily replies
- case-study content
- stronger social proof loop

7/ Building in public works when you show receipts.
We’ll keep posting wins and misses.

8/ Follow @AwakeAgent if you want the full journey.

## Thread 3 — Practical How-To (Template Hook)

1/ Quick way to make your AI agent stop forgetting things:

2/ Create `knowledge/projects/<project>.md`
This holds current project state + key decisions.

3/ Create `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
This is your daily work log.

4/ Create `knowledge/tacit.md`
This stores preferences and lessons learned.

5/ Add one instruction in AGENTS.md:
"Read relevant project docs before tasking. Write decisions to daily memory."

6/ That’s enough to go from chaotic sessions to continuity.

7/ Fancy stack optional.
Consistency mandatory.
