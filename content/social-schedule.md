## Engagement & Reply Strategy

**Target Accounts to Engage With:**
- AI founders, framework creators (e.g., Harrison Chase, Joao Moura)
- Tech influencers talking about automation and productivity
- Reply to users asking questions about CrewAI, LangChain, n8n, AutoGen.

**Action Plan:**
1. Spend 15 minutes before and after posting to leave thoughtful, value-add replies on larger accounts in the AI space.
2. Quote tweet interesting AI news with a perspective tied to "memory and architecture."
3. Never reply with just "Great post!" — always add a framework or a technical nuance.

**Hashtag Strategy:**
- Do not overuse tags. 1-2 highly relevant tags max per post.
- Core tags: `#AIAgents`, `#Automation`, `#BuildInPublic`, `#LLMs`
- Platform tags when relevant: `#ChatGPT`, `#CrewAI`, `#n8n`
